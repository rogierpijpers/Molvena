TODO notes:

Delete Account won't work (back-end function is missing)

Updating reservation and adding a room seem to have a bug with incrementing IDs and selecting by these IDs.

Reservation still uses mock-guest data, should be replaced with logged in guest (needs to implement getOwnUsername(), but currently gives an error.

No solid decision has been made yet about how we use Room Types.

String input for countries should be replaced by the new implementation for it

Role states

Registration through Jeroens code instead of CreateAccount
